Requirements Gathering
----------------------

  * **What problem are we actually trying to solve?** I want to be good at
    trivia so that I can potentially appear on a game show.
  * **What do you do to currently solve the problem?** I currently create flash
    cards to study trivia questions.
  * **What are your frustrations with the current process?** I only have a
    limited amount of index cards, and I don’t want to put in the extra effort
    to buy more from Staples. Also, I don’t want to kill the trees as it has a
    bad impact on the global environment.
  * **Who will actually use the app?** Only me.
  * **Are there any other useful features?** Yes, as a user, I want to be able
    to:
    * Fetch random questions from an online trivia database and start a quiz
      with those questions.
    * Save, study, edit, and delete questions.
    * Start a quiz with my saved questions.
  * **Do you have ideas of what you want the app to look like?** No, not yet.
